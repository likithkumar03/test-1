// Declare a Variable with the let & const Keyword

// * Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the variables.

var football = "Football"; // Change this line
var fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(football, fact); // Change this line
