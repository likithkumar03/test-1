// Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

// * Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator


let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;

// ! a should equal 4.
// ! Waiting: b should equal 27
// ! c should equal 3
